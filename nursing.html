            <p class="about__text about__text--about-page">
              Healthcare fraud is a plague to medical institutions across the industry, but it’s especially
              unsettling when it occurs in facilities that house vulnerable patients. Nursing homes and hospice
              care facilities work closely with Medicare and Medicaid to provide their patients with the
              prescriptions, treatment, and care they need in their golden years. Unfortunately, some of these
              institutions will attempt to capitalize on the weakened state of seniors and employ fraudulent
              methods in an attempt to benefit their organization financially. This creates a hazardous environment
              for seniors, as the organization that’s supposed to protect them is actively trying to use them in a
              scheme for a bigger paycheck.

            Nursing home and hospice care centers aren’t under as much supervision compared to hospitals and
            doctors’ offices, which offers the perfect opportunity for anyone trying to commit fraud. To make
            matters worse, these fraudulent organizations conceal their wrongdoings behind closed doors and out
            of the public’s eye, making it difficult for anyone outside the organization to realize there’s a
            crime occurring. However, there is one key factor that the people have against healthcare fraud in
            any institution: the courageous whistleblower. These brave individuals are often employees of the
            unethical organization and can gather the necessary evidence to start a lawsuit.

          <p class="who__paragraph-text who__paragraph-text--together">
            Healthcare fraud will look differently depending on the facility it’s occurring within,
            but here are a few examples of common fraudulent practices:

            While these fraud schemes are common across all healthcare facilities, there are many more methods
            that people will use to defraud the government. In fact, there have been cases of nursing home staff
            purposefully keeping their patients sick to qualify for more federal funding, which is especially
            unacceptable when you consider that many of these patients are too weak to fight back.

          <p class="who__paragraph-text who__paragraph-text--together">
            Nursing homes must provide residents with adequate medical care and sanitary living conditions per
            federal and state guidelines. If they fail to do so, they could be held liable for any harm that
            results from their negligence. Some nursing homes will fraudulently bill Medicare and Medicaid
            despite having unhealthy patients and poor living conditions. These organizations will claim that
            they’re using the federal funding to provide treatment for their patients, but in reality, they’re
            putting that funding into their own pocket rather than using it to improve the life of the patients
            who depend on them.

            that the crime is occurring. If your workplace commits any of the following health and safety

            Hospice Care Fraud Stops With You
          </h2>
          <p class="who__paragraph-text who__paragraph-text--together">
            Hospice facilities care for patients who don’t have much time left, but that doesn’t mean these
            individuals deserve to be mistreated. Most hospice patients will require significant treatment
            and therapies to improve their quality of life in the final years, which some hospice organizations
            will see as an opportunity to profit. Seemingly minor instances of fraud, such as double-billing,
            can add up over the years to result in millions of dollars in stolen taxpayer dollars. If they hadn’t
            committed a crime, that funding could have been used to provide the treatment someone needs to live.
            Unfortunately, hospice care fraud has become increasingly common within the industry, but all it takes
            is one brave individual to see something and stop it.
          </p>
          <p class="who__paragraph-text who__paragraph-text--together">
            One example of hospice fraud involves the Hospice of Arizona and the American Hospice Management
            organization. These institutions submitted false claims over an eight-year period by billing for
            unnecessary care and admitting patients who didn’t qualify for treatment through Medicare, which
            was only discovered after a whistleblower came forward with the information. A lawsuit was filed
            against the two organizations, and in the end, the whistleblower was awarded $1.8 million for their
            assistance.
