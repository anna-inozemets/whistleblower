            <h2>Securities and Exchange Fraud</h2>
            <p>
              The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tightly regulates the investment industry to prevent
              fraudulent individuals from interfering in business. Securities fraud, otherwise known as stock
              fraud or investment fraud, occurs when an individual or organization submits falsified information
              or omits data to persuade an investor into making an investment decision. While the SEC is
              proficient in executing its regulations, there is a difficulty in detecting these organizations
              who seek to commit fraud, as they often conceal their wrongdoing behind closed doors and out of
              the public’s eye. However, that doesn’t mean the SEC will stop trying to find instances of fraud
              within the industry.

          In fact, their 2019 Annual Report contained five basic core principles in which the SEC with target
          fraud, which are
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A focus on the Main Street investor
          </li>
          <li>
            A concentration on the individual investor and their accountability
          </li>
          <li>
            A commitment to impose remedies most successfully further their enforcement goals
          </li>
          <li>
            A constant assessment of the allocation of resources and capital
          </li>
          <li>
            A position to stay ahead of the technological curve
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While these principles may seem abstract, they allow the SEC to act proactively, not reactively, to
          instances of corruption. Whistleblowers also further this proactive response, as they’re able to gather
          solid evidence from fraudulent institutions without notifying the abuser of anything suspicious. As a
          whistleblower, you’re taking a stand against the fraud and corruption that robs everyday people of fair
          business dealings, which is why the False Claims Act (FCA) contains provisions that allow whistleblowers
          to recover 10% – 30% of the recovery if their lawsuit is successful. Our attorneys have a proven track
          record of maximizing that award for our over 100,000 clients served, making us an undeniable asset in
          your journey to fight for the greater good.

              Stay One Step Ahead of Securities and Exchange Fraud Schemes
            </h3>
            <p>
              Fraud schemes are constantly evolving and becoming more complicated. While the SEC has brought
              down systems of fraudulent activity in the past, they need your help to keep up their effort.
              Many whistleblowers were employees of the fraudulent company before coming to realize that their
              superiors were engaging in unethical business practices to further the company’s profit margin.
              These were people who went to work every morning just like you have, but their actions have helped
              hold organizations accountable for stealing millions of dollars. To notice fraud, you have to
              understand it, so here are a few common SEC fraud schemes that have resulted in lawsuits:

              Misrepresentation or Omission of Material/Electronic Information
            </h3>
            <p>
              The SEC mandates that companies and investment advisors provide accurate and honest information to
              any potential investor. If they fail to do so, it is considered fraud, and it’s only a matter of
              time until someone speaks up about their criminal behavior.

              Insider Trading

            <p>
              Companies can not disclose sensitive information to manipulate investors into purchasing stocks or
              investing. This is amongst the most common forms of SEC fraud, and it’s one of the SEC’s top fraud
              enforcement priorities moving forward.

              Embezzlement
            </h3>
            <p>
              There have been cases of CEOs, accountants, and other members of financial institutions who have
              embezzled millions of dollars from investors and other businesses. While these larger cases often
              make headlines, more minor instances of embezzlement can add up to significant amounts of stolen
              funds, as these individuals operate under the radar for years while pocketing their investors’ money.

              Ponzi-Schemes
            </h3>
            <p>
              Ponzi-schemes, or pyramid schemes, are FINRA arbitration violations where a fraudulent organization
              or individual finances earlier investors with the payments from new investors. One of the most
              noteworthy examples was Bernie Madoff’s scheme that was uncovered in 2008 and defrauded investors
              of a combined $64.8 billion.

              Manipulation of the Market Price of Securities
            </h3>
            <p>
              Companies are prohibited from interfering with sensitive stock information, delaying the release of
              said information, or engaging in “pump and dump” schemes, which occurs when an organization convinces
              a large group of investors to purchase the stock of a company to drive up the price rapidly. Once
              the price is inflated, the organization behind the scheme sells off a large portion of its stock
              in the company to take the profits while their investors lose money. Any manipulation of market
              price securities is a serious crime, but together, we can hold these organizations accountable for
              their wrongdoing.

            <p>
              The SEC requires financial institutions and the employees within them to act responsibly with their
              client’s money. This fraud can take various forms, such as diversion of client funds into
              unauthorized transactions, charging exorbitant commission fees, and churning customer accounts,
              but the harm is all the same. No investor should have their money stolen by the organization they
              trusted to act responsibly with their investment, regardless of the profits they may make.

              The SEC determines which companies can publicly trade their stock to investors. If an investment
              advisor or financial institution uses a client’s investment to purchase an unauthorized security,
              it’s considered fraud and they could be held liable for their actions.
