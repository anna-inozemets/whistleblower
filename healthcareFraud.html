            <h2>Healthcare Fraud</h2>
            <p>
              Our nations’ federal and state governments annually spend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars
              on government funded healthcare and prescriptions drug programs. These vast sums provide needed
              healthcare access to the most vulnerable in our communities. The funding for these programs comes
              straight from the pockets of hardworking citizens. When a doctor or medical facility acts
              fraudulently with these resources, it ultimately hurts the public more than the government, as
              they’re the ones who will ultimately pay the price through their own tax dollars. Unfortunately,
              healthcare fraud is the most commonplace fraud, but that doesn’t mean we have to stand idly while
              it occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, under federal and state False Claims Act (FCA) statutes, ordinary citizens can file
              whistleblower/qui tam lawsuits in federal and state courts. These lawsuits are intended to give the
              government information and evidence of the fraud. If the government successfully pursues and recovers
              monies from the defendants named in the lawsuits, the whistleblower may be entitled between 15-30% of
              all the monies the government recovers.

        Who Can Blow the Whistle on Hospitals, Doctors Offices, and Other Medical Facilities?

      <p>
        In many cases, medical facilities that are committing fraud will conceal their wrongdoing from the
        public and behind closed doors. Anyone within or outside the organization who has knowledge of overbilling,
        the payment of illegal kickbacks, or any other fraudulent activity can file a lawsuit on behalf of the

        Whistleblowers tend to be apprehensive about coming forward and volunteering information regarding fraud
        in the workplace. This concern is based upon the fear of facing retaliation from their employer. However,
        the federal and state laws contain provisions that provide qualified whistleblowers with legal remedies if
        they experience retaliation from their employer. Our experienced attorneys will guide you throughout this
        process and ensure your legal options are protected.

            Qui Tam Lawsuites: Types of Fraud
          </h3>
          <p>
            Fraud occurs when a doctor’s office, hospital, or other medical facility attempts to deceive the
            federal government for its own financial gain. Whistleblower lawsuits have arisen from all types of
            fraud, including:

          </h3>
          <p>
            Phantom billing, or the billing for uncharged services, occurs when a medical facility charges the
            government for services they never performed.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Doctors and other medical staff may perform medically unnecessary services on their patients to
            bolster their organization’s finances. Once the procedure is completed, the medical professional
            will send their bill to Medicare/Medicaid, then fraudulently collect money that isn’t rightfully
            theirs.

            When a healthcare organization fraudulently alters diagnosis or treatment codes to become eligible
            for increased reimbursements from the government, it’s considered to be “Up-Coding.” This behavior
            is difficult to detect unless you’re close to the source, which makes the involvement of a
            whistleblower much more important.

            Unbundling
          </h3>
          <p>
            Unbundling occurs when a healthcare provider bills separately for related services that are properly
            billed under a single procedure or code. By separating expenses, the healthcare provider aims to
            improperly seek greater reimbursements.

          <p>
            The waiver of co-pays for government health plan patients is frequently used to improperly incentivize
            beneficiaries in obtaining goods and services. Government healthcare plans require co-pays as it’s a
            useful mechanism to ensure beneficiaries have a financial interest in the care they receive. Without
            that financial interest, there really is no obstacle to over-utilization of healthcare goods and
            services.

            Prescription drugs differ in price depending on their manufacturer. If a healthcare organization
            knowingly gives a patient a generic drug and charges the Government health plan for the name-brand
            alternative, then fraud has occurred.

            drugs must adhere to for their products to be used in a healthcare setting. These regulations coincide
            with the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and are used to ensure that all the equipment that

            The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, also known as HIPAA, is a law that

            fail to disclose the unauthorized release of PHI. However, HIPAA’s privacy rule contains a Permitted

          Any entity or individual billing federal healthcare programs has the potential and opportunity to
          commit fraud. Thus, the reason why whistleblowers are so important for detecting and recovering
          healthcare fraud. In fact, the Department of Justice recently reported that of the $5.6 billion
          in Federal FCA successfully resolved cases in 2021, $5.0 billion involved healthcare.

        <p>
          That’s why our nation needs whistleblowers, and we’re here to ensure that the process moves as
          easily as possible for anyone who has evidence of fraudulent activity. Our team of highly experienced
