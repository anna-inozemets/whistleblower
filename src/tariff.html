            <h2>Tariff/Duty Fraud</h2>
            <p>
              Any company that imports goods into the U.S. must supply accurate information on those goods to the
              government and pay its fair share of import duties (tariffs) per federal guidelines. These
              regulations were established to promote fairness within the industries these companies exist in, as
              any business that pays fewer tariffs than another will have an unfair advantage when it’s time to
              sell their imported products. Unfortunately, some companies see that unfair advantage as an
              opportunity that’s too good to pass up, and many will employ fraudulent methods in an attempt to
              earn a more substantial profit. To make matters worse, these abusers will often conceal their
              wrongdoing behind closed doors and away from the public’s eye, making it difficult for anyone on
              the outside to hold them accountable for their crimes.

      <p>
        That’s why the world needs whistleblowers. These brave individuals are often employees or subcontractors
        of the fraudulent organization and can gather the evidence necessary to file a lawsuit without notifying
        the organization of anything amiss. Tariff/duty fraud deprives the government of funding, harms domestic
        workers, and creates an unfair environment where all businesses must try to compete with the price points
        of the fraudulent organization, which makes it difficult for any honest business to turn a profit. The
        harm is widespread, yet these organizations think nothing of misclassifying goods and failing to disclose
        honest information on their imported goods despite the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a whistleblower, you’re playing a critical role in promoting fairness across all commercial industries,
        but we understand how difficult of a decision it is to come forward. Many whistleblowers fear that the
        organization they’re helping to expose will retaliate against them, but you should know that the False
        Claims Act (FCA) contains provisions that offer protections for whistleblowers against this malicious
        behavior. Our attorneys are well versed in all aspects of whistleblower and qui tam litigation, allowing
        us to give you the best possible chance of success while staying anonymous throughout the duration of
        your case. With over 100,000 clients served and the resources of America’s Largest Personal Injury firm
        behind us, our firm is uniquely capable of handling a whistleblower case of any size, regardless of the
        organization we’re holding accountable.

            <h3>
              Tariff and Duty Fraud Can Vary; Our Stance Does Not
            </h3>
            <p>
              All instances of tariff and duty fraud rob the American people of fairness in commercial business
              relationships. If one company is able to bypass its fair share of taxes, it can sell its products
              at a lower price, making it more difficult for other businesses within the industry to compete with
              their price points. However, there is no shortage of fraud schemes that these companies will rely
              on to bolster their profits fraudulently, but here are a few examples of more common types of fraud
              that affect the import industry:
            </p>

          <div class="who__paragraph who__paragraph--pharm">
            <h3>
              Misclassification of Goods
            </h3>
            <p>
              Tariffs and import duties are based on the type of product the company receives, with each
              specific rate determined by the Harmonized Tax Schedule of the United States (HTS). For example,
              if a company were to import a car, they would have to pay the tax rate that applies to that vehicle,
              much like any other company would if they purchased that same car. Fraudulent companies, seeking to
              avoid paying a high tariff on their imported goods, will sometimes falsify documentation related to
              their imported products to persuade the government into believing that the product falls into a
              different, less expensive tax rate. They do this to gain an advantage over their competitors,
              but any instance of misclassification of goods is a federal offense, and it’s only a matter of
              time until their crimes come to light.
            </p>

          <div class="who__paragraph who__paragraph--pharm">
            <h3>
              Undervaluation of Goods
            </h3>
            <p>
              The value of imported goods also plays a role in how much the company that’s receiving the product
              pays in tariffs and duties. If a shipment of goods is valued at a high price, the tax rate is
              higher as well, but some companies will intentionally undervalue their imports to pay less in tariffs.
              While they might believe that their actions aren’t harming anyone, it’s actually enforcing an unfair
              attitude within their industry, and they could be held liable for the violation through a whistleblower
              lawsuit.

            <h3>
              Misrepresenting Country of Origin
            </h3>
            <p>
              Tariff rates can differ depending on the country the product is coming from. If the country is less
              developed and has a need to protect their growing industry, they’ll require higher tariffs to import
              their products, as they want to maximize the cash flow into their country. These rates also depend
              on other factors, such as the relationship between the country and the United States, but they’re
              enforced heavily to ensure that all business dealings are treated fairly across the board. In some
              cases, companies will misrepresent their imported product’s country of origin on the information
              they supply to the government to avoid paying the higher rates. They also do this to avoid
              anti-dumping duties and countervailing tariffs.
