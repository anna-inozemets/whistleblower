            <p class="about__text about__text--about-page">
              The FDA highly regulates the pharmaceutical industry to ensure the safety of all medication and
              medical equipment before it lands in the hands of consumers. Doctors and all other medical
              professionals must abide by these regulations, and if they fail to do so, it can have serious
              consequences for the patients who rely on these institutions. Unfortunately, some unethical
              organizations will still choose to employ fraudulent methods to bypass the guidelines and bolster the
              profit margin of their organization, despite the risk of the harm their actions may have. Kickbacks,
              illegal drug switching, and other fraudulent methods might seem innocuous to the people who commit
              them, but in reality, they’re robbing taxpayers and creating an unfair environment for all those who
              rely on federal programs honestly.

            Many potential whistleblowers in the pharmaceutical industry fear that their evidence will violate
            HIPAA guidelines. However, HIPAA contains privacy provisions that allow individuals to disclose private
            health information if it’s used to expose instances of fraud. The pharmaceutical industry keeps this
            secret, as this provision allows whistleblowers to hold organizations accountable for their crimes,
            but its inclusion is critical in helping maintain fairness across federally funded programs.

            Whistleblowers stand as the strongest line of defense against fraud and corruption in the pharmaceutical
            industry. These brave individuals are often employees or subcontractors of the fraudulent organization,
            allowing them to gather the evidence necessary to file a lawsuit without alerting the abuser. As a
            whistleblower, you could be eligible for a financial award of 10% - 30% of the total amount recovered,
            and our attorneys have a proven track record of maximizing that award for our clients.

              Our Firm Can Tackle Any Form of Pharmaceutical Fraud & FDA Fraud
            </h3>
            <p class="who__paragraph-text">
              Any organization that does business with the federal government can also defraud them, and there is
              no shortage of methods that these organizations will employ to reach that goal. Much like other
              industries, fraudulent practices, such as overbilling and double-billing, plague the pharmaceutical
              arena, but there are also other fraud schemes that affect the industry specifically, such as the
              off-label marketing of drugs. However, all fraud will look differently depending on the facility
              it’s occurring within. Here are a few examples of common fraud schemes in the pharmaceutical industry:

              Kickbacks
            </h3>
            <p class="who__paragraph-text">
              It’s illegal for pharmaceutical companies to offer compensation, benefits, or discounts in exchange
              for prescribing the company’s drugs. For example, some companies have been found to have offered golf
              outings, tickets to special events, and even direct payments of cash to persuade another organization
              into purchasing their medication. Additionally, the federal government also prohibits the business
              practice of “tying” drugs, which is when a pharmaceutical company provides a discount on one
              medication to encourage the purchase of a different drug. Any instance of a kickback creates a very
              hazardous environment for patients everywhere, as the fraud encourages doctors to make decisions
              based on money rather than on what medication is right for that individual.
            </p>

              Off-Label Marketing of Drugs
            </h3>
            <p class="who__paragraph-text">
              Medications and medical equipment must first gain approval by the FDA before they’re allowed to be
              used in practice. This approval is determined through clinical trials, where the FDA will test the
              product for its intended purpose. If it’s determined to be safe and effective, doctors can begin
              prescribing it to their patients, but it can only be given for the purpose that the FDA tested.
              While some medications can treat a number of different ailments, all doctors and medical
              professionals are strictly prohibited from prescribing drugs for any purpose other than FDA-approved
              use.

              Failure to Adhere to Quality and Control Procedures
            </h3>
            <p class="who__paragraph-text">
              The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) strictly prohibits the “adulteration” of drugs, which is
              when the methods or quality control procedures used in the manufacturing, packing, processing, or
              holding of the drug fails to adhere to the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations.
              Any instance of adulteration significantly decreases the trustworthiness of medications and medical
              equipment, as doctors and regulatory agencies need to know that the product was made correctly before
              administering it to a patient. cGMP regulations also mandate that pharmaceutical manufacturers
              maintain adequately equipped facilities, thoroughly trained staff, and strict control over their
              drug manufacturing process. Instances of cGMP violations can include keeping incomplete testing
              records and failing to keep investigation data, manufacturing goods for sale that the FDA disapproves,
              and employing individuals prior to their training completion.

              Clinical Trial Fraud
            </h3>
            <p class="who__paragraph-text">
              Pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers must obtain FDA approval prior to the sale
              of their products. If the company submits false data during any stage of the clinical trial to obtain
              approval, they are breaking the law and can be held responsible through their crime with the help of
              a brave whistleblower. Some companies choose to withhold negative side effects, misrepresent the
              effectiveness, or falsify documentation related to the performance of their medical device. While
              they might think that their actions have no consequence, they’re truly hurting the people their
              products are supposed to help, and it’s only a matter of time until they’re held accountable.
